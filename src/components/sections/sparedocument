            <p class="text-center px-3 fs-5">
              I am a 23-year-old who has always been passionate about coding and
              technology. After a year and a half as a Network Engineer, I
              decided to bet on my passion for development and enroll in a Full
              Stack Web Developer course where I learned the basics. My journey
              begins now, and I hope it will worth it.
